# Desktop-First Top-Down Development Approach

**1. Design for Large Screens First**

Build the full-size version of the website, maximizing available screen space.

**2. Adapt for Smaller Devices**

Use @media queries to define breakpoints and ensure responsive styling.

**3. Utilize Mock Data**

Since the API isn’t ready, simulate user interactions with mock data.

**4. Refine the UI and Define the API**

Ensure the UI is fully responsive and functional across all screen sizes.

**5. Align the API with Frontend Needs**

Design an API that supports the frontend’s requirements.

Gradually replace mock data with real API calls while validating responses and handling errors.

**6. Develop and Integrate the Backend**

Build the backend and database schema based on the finalized frontend structure.

**7. Validate API Interactions**

Ensure seamless communication between the UI and backend.

This Top-Down Development approach ensures that the UI dictates data structure and interactions, resulting in a user-centric, scalable, and efficient application.
